Hey yall we officially present to you the AskTrickShaq-IRA. This fantastic piece of engineering is POINT-LESS. This machine is an integration of Arduino Leonardo, HTML and lots of exciting hardware designs. The hardware includes 2 servo motors, an LED, a button, bottle, cardboard, paper and adhesives. 

How it works:


There is a website that asks math questions to people if you manage to enter the answer in the box, that will allow you to make a trickshot into a hoop.

Once the ball is launched it just never goes in because Shaqira Oâ€™ Neil is always blocking the shot.

So better luck next time LOSERS!ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
